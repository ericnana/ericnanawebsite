Hey, I am Eric Nana! I am fascinated by machine learning and deep learning. I decided to create a web site written in python. 
It contains a work section composed of several topics that I am going to focus on and get filled with content gradually.

# Prerequisites
In order to run this you need to fill under settings_ the common with your own settings
Add as well requirements.txt

# Running
Just do sudo python3 manage.py runserver from your command line after switching to your virtual environmental if you want it
Add --insecure to sudo python3 manage.py runserver in case the static file is broken
